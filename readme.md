# Whack-A-Mole

Because you shouldn't take yourself seriously all the time.  This is a clone of the classic Whack-A-Mole game, using Javascript, CSS3, HTML5.  External libraries include jQuery, Twitter Boostrap and Google Fonts.  Initial progression of this game can be seen in my repository named [codeup.dev](https://github.com/bcbeidel/codeup.dev)
